          commentary: `
                    <p>When we perceive things through the perspective of knowledge, it is called prajñā chakṣhu, which means “with the eyes of knowledge.”  Shree Krishna uses the words vidyā sampanne to the same effect, but He also adds vinaya, meaning “humbleness.”  The sign of divine knowledge is that it is accompanied by a sense of humility, while shallow bookish knowledge is accompanied with the pride of scholarship. 

Shree Krishna reveals in this verse how divine knowledge bestows a vision so different from physical sight.  Endowed with knowledge, devotees see all living beings as souls who are fragments of God, and are therefore divine in nature.  The examples given by Shree Krishna are of diametrically contrasting species and life forms.  A Vedic Brahmin who conducts worship ceremonies is respected, while a dog-eater is usually looked down upon as an outcaste; a cow is milked for human consumption, but not a dog; an elephant is used for ceremonial parades, while neither the cow or the dog are.  From the physical perspective, these species are sharp contrasts in the spectrum of life on our planet.  However, a truly learned person endowed with spiritual knowledge sees them all as eternal souls, and hence views them with an equal eye.

The Vedas do not support the view that the Brahmins (priestly class) are of higher caste, while the Shudras (labor class) are of lower caste.  The perspective of knowledge is that even though the Brahmins conduct worship ceremonies, the Kṣhatriyas administer society, the Vaiśhyas conduct business, and the Shudras engage in labor, yet they are all eternal souls, who are tiny parts of God, and hence alike.</p>

                    <p> Those whose minds are established in equality of vision conquer the cycle of birth and death in this very life. They possess the flawless qualities of God, and are therefore seated in the Absolute Truth.</p>
                `,
          commentary: `
                    <p>Sri Krishna uses the word sāmye to mean one possessed of an equal vision toward all living beings, as explained in the previous verse.  Further, equality in vision also means to rise beyond likes and dislikes, happiness and misery, pleasure and pain.  Shree Krishna says that those who are able to do so transcend the samsara of repeated birth and death.

So long as we think of ourselves as the body, we cannot attain this equality of vision because we will experience continued desires and aversions for bodily pleasures and discomforts.  Saints rise above bodily consciousness and absorb their minds in God, giving up all worldly attachments.  The Ramayan states:

sevahiṅ lakhanu sīya raghubīrahi, jimi abibekī puruṣha sarīrahi.

“Lakshman served Lord Ram and Sita, just as an ignorant person serves his body.” 

When one’s mind is situated in this divine consciousness, attachment to bodily pleasures and pains get transcended, and one reaches a state of equanimity.  This equipoise that comes through the sacrifice of selfish bodily desires makes one godlike in demeanor.  The Mahabharat states: yo na kāmayate kiñchit brahma bhūyāya kalpate  “One who gives up desires becomes like God.”</p>

We are incontrovertible in the conviction that the harm done to any of our limbs is harm done to ourselves. Similarly, those who see God in all beings consider the joys and sorrows of others as their own. Therefore, such yogis are always the well-wishers of all souls and they strive for the eternal benefit of all. This is the sama-darśhana (equality of vision) of perfected yogis.</p>

            meaning: `
                    <p>I am equally disposed to all living beings; I am neither inimical nor partial to anyone. But the devotees who worship Me with love reside in Me and I reside in them.</p>
            `,
            commentary: `
                    <p>We all intuitively believe that if there is a God, He must be perfectly just; there cannot be an unjust God.  People suffering injustice in the world make statements such as, “Mr. Billionaire, you have the power of money on your side. Do what you like.  God will settle our dispute.  He is watching and will definitely punish you.  You cannot escape.”  This sort of statement does not indicate that the person making it is a saint, possessing absolute faith in God, for even common persons believe that God is perfectly just. 

However, the previous verse by Shree Krishna creates the doubt that God is partial toward His devotees, because while everyone is subject to the law of karma, God releases His devotees from it.  Isn’t this symptomatic of the defect of partiality?  Shree Krishna feels it necessary to clarify this point and begins the verse by saying samo’ ham, meaning, “No, no, I am equal to all.  But I have a uniform law in accordance with which I bestow My grace.”  This law was previously stated in verse 4.11: “In whatever way people surrender unto Me, I reciprocate accordingly. Everyone follows my path, knowingly or unknowingly, O son of Pritha.”

The rainwater falls equally upon the earth.  Yet, the drop that falls on the cornfields gets converted into grain; the drop that falls on the desert bush gets converted into a thorn; the drop that falls in the gutter becomes dirty water; and the drop that falls in the oyster becomes a pearl.  There is no partiality on the part of the rain, since it is equitable in bestowing its grace upon the land.  The raindrops cannot be held responsible for this variation in results, which are a consequence of the nature of the recipient.  Similarly, God states here that He is equally disposed toward all living beings, and yet, those who do not love Him are bereft of the benefits of His grace because their hearts are unsuitable vessels for receiving it.  So, what can people do whose hearts are impure?  Shree Krishna now reveals the purifying power of bhakti.</p>
